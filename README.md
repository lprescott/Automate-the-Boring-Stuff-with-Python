# [Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
This is my personal repo that stores code used in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart; it also stores code that I have completed while following along said book. 

The examples contained within the book are in the [Examples](https://github.com/lprescott/Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python/edit/master/Examples/) folder, and the projects I have completed while pursueing comprehension of the book are in the [Projects](https://github.com/lprescott/Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python/edit/master/Projects/) folder.
